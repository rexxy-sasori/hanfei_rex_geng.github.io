A Short Introduction
Graduate research and teaching assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a focus on resource-constrained deep learning algorithms. Extensive C++ development and python scripting experience including prototyping low-complexity deep neural networks using PyTorch. Interested in approaching challenging problems with solid foundations in signal processing, probability, and communication theory, followed by designing better software for validation.

I was a bronze-tablet recipient when I received my bachelor's degree for my academic achievement placing top 3% in the College of Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I completed 2 internships on Sensing and Connectivity Team of Apple Inc.
